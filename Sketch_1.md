# DM-UY 1133-A Creative Coding
##### Spring 2020 • Katherine Bennett • Monday & Wednesdays • 2:30-4:20pm 

## Sketch 1 Creature

#### Due February 5
			
Come to class on Feb 5 with code that does the following:

Write a program that creates a creature. Use at least 5 different colors and at least 7 different shapes (MINIMUM). Can you do more? Can you stylize your creature? How can you make them interesting and notable? How is their personality visually evident? We need to be able to look at your monster and to distinguish 2 personality traits. 

Get creative and have fun!

The more, the better. Are they located in a space, environment or landscape?

One way to interpret this is to think of different emotions that can be visually evident with multiple changes of the graphics. (not just one change, but multiple)

Use different shapes, colors, opacities, sizes, position, etc.

To isolate particular emotions or scenes, organize your code with comments (regarding what the code does) and group it with similar or related code. Then, be able to turn certain lines of code "on" or "off" via comment/uncomment.
