# DM-UY 1133-A Creative Coding
##### Spring 2020 • Katherine Bennett • Monday & Wednesdays • 2:30-4:20pm 

### Sketch 2

### Interactive Repetition & Drawing: Modularity, Pattern

#### Due February 11 NOON
        

 Using 1 small line or small simple shape (ellipse), twist or turn it and position it within space. Repeat this process, changing the orientation and position, yet keeping it close to the previous shape. Repeat this process at least 3-5 more times. By the end, you should a clustered arrangement of similar shapes. Wrap this into a code block: either a for-loop or a simple function.

 Use the previously created arrangement of shapes, as the mold that you will use to create different patterns across the sketch window. You are to create 5 DRASTICALLY different grid-like patterns. Start with creating one grid. Then in subsequent (and different patterns), manipulate that grid so that it is less grid-like. How can you start to deviate from a grid? How can that grid be transformed into a cone? Or strips? Can you skip every other one? 

 Variables, loops, and exit conditions are your key. Play and experiment here. Try different things out. Play with your operators, as well as how much you are operating by (ie, 1? 2?). What happens when you throw an if-statement within the loop? EXPERIMENT WITH YOUR OPERATORS, LOOP CONDITIONS, & IF-STATEMENTS

 Consider different rhythms that you can make with spacing, direction/orientation and repetition. Use a keyPress to switch between different patterns. As a result, all of your patterns should appear in ONE sketch

 - use active mode
 - use variables
 - use loops (for, while). Make sure there is an exit condition
 - use a conditional(s) to make your pattern interesting, unique, and to have variety
